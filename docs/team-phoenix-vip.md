# Team Phoenix VIP Class

The Team Phoenix VIP class provides a structured opportunity for students to learn about high-performance computing topics and to participate in student cluster competitions at venues like Supercomputing and the International Supercomputing Conference.

See our 2021 [Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Computing (UROC) presentation slides](files/2021/Team_Phoenix_VIP_UROC_Spring_2021.pdf) for some additional details!

## What is the goal of “Team Phoenix?”
We want to train teams for the national Supercomputing Student Cluster Competition (SCC), where you race against a 48-hour clock to assemble, evaluate, and manage the fastest and most reliable cluster you can given a specific power budget and occasional surprise power failures.

## What skills do you need to join?
* Proficiency in a “systems-oriented” programming language, like C, C++, recommended
* Experience with modeling and simulation, numerical methods, or data analysis
* Familiarity with command-line environments and scripting (Linux)

## What majors are eligible? 
* CS, CM, ECE, and ME are especially well-suited, but anyone with an interest in computer-based modeling and simulation is welcome!

## What topics will you learn about in this course?
* Parallel algorithms for shared memory and distributed memory systems, including how to reason about correctness and scalability
* Multicore and GPU programming in OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA
* Performance analysis and profiling
* Basic performance enhancement and tuning techniques, including how to use advanced features of a compiler
* How to manage a cluster system
* How real parallel applications “look and feel”
* How to estimate the “speed of light” of a program

### How is the course graded?
* Like all VIP courses, you are required to keep a weekly notebook for the course with your Todos and items discussed with your subteam. 
* You will work in "subteams" of 5-7 students, with each team focused on a specific competition deadline. Each subteam is responsible for developing an application and any related materials like posters ([see an example here](files/2020/gt_vscc_supercomputing20_poster.pdf)).
* You are required to do two short peer evaluations each semester as part of the VIP program to evaluate your subteam's group dynamics.
* There are no final exams - this is more of a project-oriented course!
