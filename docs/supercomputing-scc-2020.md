# Team Phoenix at Supercomputing 2021

2020 saw the restart of the GT SCC team as well as the introduction of "Team Phoenix" as our competition team. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we competed in a virtual fashion using the Azure cloud. Team Phoenix ended up placing 3rd out of 19 teams! 

Check out the [VSCC 2020 Poster](files/gt_vscc_supercomputing20_poster.pdf) for an overview of the team and our preparation strategy.
